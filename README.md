## Task 1

Flow meters are devices used to measure the volumetric or mass flow  of a fluid with ultrasound. However, these devices present serious  engineering problems that give rise to a defective meter function and  cause errors in reading the flow velocity.

In this study, we analyze a database with the characteristics of a  liquid ultrasonic flowmeter and its state (healthy or unhealthy) to know the relevant factors that cause failures in the system.

Therefore, a solution that balances accurate measurement and the necessary costs of recalibration is needed.

**N.B.** This problem is the foundation of this  internship program and you will get three weeks to learn the required  technology and tools. The mentor will help you to complete the tasks of  this problem.



### Solution

We used logistics regression as the model. And for training and testing we split the data into 0.6:0.4 ratio by holdout classification.

So, far we got 0.57 accuracy. But I think we can do better.
